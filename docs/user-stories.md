# Product Feedback System - User Stories

## Core (MVP)
1. As a user, I can create a feedback request so I can suggest improvements.
2. As a user, I can edit or delete my feedback so I can keep it up to date.
3. As a user, I can view all feedback suggestions so I can see other usersâ€™ ideas.
4. As a user, I can sort suggestions by most upvotes or comments so I can prioritize them.
5. As a user, I can filter feedback by category so I can focus on relevant ideas.
6. As a user, I can add comments and replies so I can join discussions.
7. As a user, I can upvote feedback requests so I can support ideas I like.

## Advanced (Planned)
1. As an admin, I can view analytics about the most requested features so I can make informed decisions.
2. As a user, I can see AI-generated sentiment scores for each feedback request.
3. As an admin, I can manage categories and tags for feedback.
4. As a user, I receive real-time updates when new feedback or comments are added.
5. As an admin, I can control user roles and permissions.
